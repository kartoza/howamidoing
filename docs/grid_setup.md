# Grid Setup
This document will explain KmGrid setup,so you can have grid with population data in it.

The setup is as simple as follows:
```
$ cd howamidoing-backend/
$ python manage.py import_grid --file /path/to/grid/file/grid_file.geojson
```

You can check the GEOJson file example [here](https://github.com/kartoza/howamidoing-backend/blob/develop/example/grid.geojson)
